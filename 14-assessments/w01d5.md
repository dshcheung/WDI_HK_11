# Assessment W1/D5
## Bootstrap
1. How many columns are there in the Bootstrap Grid System?
1. What are the 4 prefixes of the Bootstrap Grid System (i.e. col-`??`-1)?
1. What is the difference between `.container` and `.container-fluid` in Bootstrap?


## JavaScript
1. Write an expression that returns the first element of array `x`
1. Write an expression that returns the last element of array `x`
1. Assume array `x` contains an **odd** number of elements (i.e. its length is an odd number). Write an expression that returns the **MIDDLE** element of the array.
   ``` javascript
   //example
   var x = [8,4,3,9,0,1,4];
   //the expression you write will return 9 in this case
   ```

1. What is the difference between while and do-while?
1. In the following JavaScript code, replace the for loop with a while loop.

   ``` javascript
   var array = "h,e,l,l,o, ,w,o,r,l,d".split(',');
   for (var i = 1; i < array.length; i += 3) {
     var t = array[i-1];
     array[i-1] = array[i];
     array[i] = t;
   }
   ```

## Bonus
In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example:
![equation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/3/9/939c013423574cad70f33eaa7dd68f0c.png)

Write some JavaScript code to calculate the factorial of `n` and store the answer in a variable called `f`.

   ``` javascript
   var n = 5;   // n can be any integer >= 1
   var f = /* Hint: What should be the initial value of this variable? */
   //
   // Your code here
   //
   console.log(f);
   ```
